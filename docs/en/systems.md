|つ/ツ              |tsu       |tu           |tu          |
|ふ/フ              |fu        |hu           |hu          |
|**As particles**   |          |             |            |
|は                 |wa        |wa           |ha          |
|へ                 |e         |e            |he          |
|を                 |o         |o            |wo          |

Hepburn's system involves more consonants, and thus has more variation in spelling. This variation is also evident in the expanded kana. For example, the rare combination ファ in the Hepburn system forms a new syllable _fa_. Using the other two systems, we get the existing syllable _ha_.

Polivanov's system is extremely widespread and has no competitors. Differences in transliteration are mostly found at the amateur level. The deviation follows the same scenario, so that it can be conventionally separated into a second system; let's call it *nonstandard*.

_In addition to Nonstandard, **Static** has been added. It is characterized by the unchanged spelling of kana in the particle position, similar to Nihon-shiki._

|Kana/system       | Nonstandard | Polivanov's | Static |
|:----------------:|:-------------:|:----------:|:---------:|
|し/シ              |щи            |си          |си         |
|ち/チ              |чи            |ти          |ти         |
|じ/ジ, ぢ/ヂ       |джи           |дзи         |дзи         |
|**As particles**  |             |            |            |
|は                 |ва           |ва          |ха          |
|へ                 |э            |э           |хэ          |
|を                 |о            |о           |во          |

Nonstandard offers more consonants, like the Hepburn system in English. This makes it possible to form more syllables with the extended kana.
